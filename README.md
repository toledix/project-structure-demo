# Project Structure Demo

A project structure demonstration with organized `/api` and `/app` folders, each containing comprehensive README files to guide development.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
project-structure-demo/
├── api/           # Backend API module
│   └── README.md  # API documentation and setup guide
├── app/           # Frontend application module
│   └── README.md  # App documentation and setup guide
└── README.md      # This file - main project documentation
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### API Module (`/api`)
The API folder contains all backend-related code and documentation. This includes:
- API endpoints and routes
- Authentication and middleware
- Database connections and models
- API documentation

👉 **[View API Documentation](./api/README.md)**

### App Module (`/app`)
The App folder contains all frontend-related code and components. This includes:
- User interface components
- Frontend framework setup
- Styling and design systems
- Client-side routing and state management

👉 **[View App Documentation](./app/README.md)**

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Setup Development Environment**
   - Clone this repository
   - Install dependencies for both API and App modules
   - Configure environment variables

2. **API Development**
   - Follow the setup guide in `/api/README.md`
   - Implement your backend endpoints
   - Set up database connections
   - Add authentication and authorization

3. **Frontend Development**
   - Follow the setup guide in `/app/README.md`
   - Choose and configure your frontend framework
   - Implement UI components and pages
   - Connect to API endpoints

4. **Integration & Testing**
   - Test API endpoints
   - Implement end-to-end functionality
   - Add automated testing
   - Set up deployment pipelines

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. Each module (`/api` and `/app`) should be developed independently
2. Use the respective README files for module-specific setup and guidelines
3. Follow consistent coding standards across both modules
4. Document any changes or new features in the relevant README files

## 📝 Contributing

When contributing to this project:
1. Update the relevant module README when adding new features
2. Keep this main README updated with any structural changes
3. Follow the established folder structure and naming conventions
